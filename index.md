          date: 11 June 2024
          announcement: Simple, no-frills roasted meats. Highly recommended is the roasted
            chicken riceâ€”plump and succulent. The best part is the hawkers are
            really friendly, making it my go-to stall to satisfy my chicken rice
            cravings.

          date: 25 May 2024
          announcement: This seafood restaurant captures the charm of old-school hawker
            style. Highly recommended is their butter crayfish, which is
            enveloped in fragrant butter and crunchy cereal. The crayfish meat
            is incredibly fresh, juicy, and tender, promising an epicurean
            delight.

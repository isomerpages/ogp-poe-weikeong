          date: 11 June 2024
          announcement: Simple, no-frills roasted meats. Highly recommend their roasted
            chicken riceâ€”plump and succulent. The best part is the hawkers are
            really friendly and generous, making it my go-to stall to satisfy my
            chicken rice cravings.

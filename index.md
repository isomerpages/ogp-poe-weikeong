          date: 11 June 2024
          announcement: Simple, no-frills charcoal roasted delight. Highly recommend their
            roasted chicken riceâ€”plump and succulent. The best part are the
            friendly and generous hawkers, cementing  it as my go-to stall to
            satisfy my chicken rice cravings.

          announcement: This seafood restaurant captures the charm of old-school hawker
            style. Highly recommend their butter crayfish, which is enveloped in
            fragrant butter and crunchy cereal. The crayfish meat is incredibly
            fresh, juicy, and tender, promising an epicurean delight.
